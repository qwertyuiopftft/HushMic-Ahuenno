Version:        0.2.1
Release:        1%{?dist}
Summary:        Real-time microphone noise suppression as a virtual mic

# The release ships a prebuilt x86-64 binary (glibc 2.35 floor).
ExclusiveArch:  x86_64

BuildRequires:  coreutils

# pipewire-utils owns every pw-* tool the tray shells out to (pw-dump,
# pw-metadata, pw-record, pw-play). They are subprocesses, so RPM's ELF-based
# dependency generator cannot see them, and `pipewire` does NOT pull the utils
# in — without this line the package installs cleanly and then reports an empty
# microphone list. Fedora's analogue of the .deb's pipewire-bin dependency.

%description
HushMic runs DPDFNet noise suppression on your microphone in real time and
exposes the cleaned audio as a PipeWire virtual microphone, so any application
can select it. Processing is local and CPU-only; audio never leaves the machine.

This package installs the binary from the upstream release, together with the
ONNX Runtime it was built and tested against.

# NOTE: /usr/lib, deliberately NOT %%{_libdir} (which is /usr/lib64 here).
# The tray resolves the plugin, models and runtime relative to its own install
# prefix (/usr/bin/hushmic -> /usr) and only ever looks under <prefix>/lib —
# see Paths::resolve() in controller.rs. Installing into /usr/lib64 would leave
# those lookups falling back to a /usr/lib path that does not exist, and the
# filter chain would fail at enable() time.

# symlink chain and only the real file may land as a regular file. Keep the
# unversioned .so even though rpmlint calls it a devel file: it is the exact
# path Paths::resolve() dlopens at runtime, not a link-time artifact.
