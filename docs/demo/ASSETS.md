## 1. Voice (clean speech)
- **Title:** Short Poetry Collection 266 — track 02, "After Love" by **Sara Teasdale** (public-domain poem)
- **Source item:** https://archive.org/details/spc266_2508_librivox
- **Direct file:** https://archive.org/download/spc266_2508_librivox/spc266_afterlove_pac_128kb.mp3
- **Author/credit:** Poem by Sara Teasdale (d. 1933, public domain); read by a LibriVox
  volunteer (catalog reader id `pac`).
- **License:** Public Domain — LibriVox recordings are released into the public domain
  (item `licenseurl` = http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/).
- **Format used:** 44.1 kHz mono MP3 (128 kbps); a 10.75 s passage from the poem body
  (offset 17.55–28.30 s: three phrases with two natural speech pauses, chosen so the
  noise-only gaps make the suppression audible) was extracted, resampled to 48 kHz
  mono, and loudness-normalized to −20 dBFS RMS.

## 2. Keyboard noise (mechanical typing)
- **Title:** File:Typing on Keychron V1 Ultra (Red Linear Switch).wav
- **File page:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Typing_on_Keychron_V1_Ultra_(Red_Linear_Switch).wav
- **Direct file:** https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Typing_on_Keychron_V1_Ultra_%28Red_Linear_Switch%29.wav
- **Author/credit:** Wikimedia Commons user **C40115** (own work).
- **License:** **CC BY 4.0** — https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
- **Format:** 48 kHz stereo WAV, 17.7 s. (Mechanical keyboard, linear switches.)

## 3. Fan noise (steady fan/AC hum)
- **Title:** File:Air conditioner hum (Gravity Sound).wav
- **File page:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Air_conditioner_hum_(Gravity_Sound).wav
- **Direct file:** https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Air_conditioner_hum_%28Gravity_Sound%29.wav
- **Author/credit:** **Gravity Sound** (https://www.gravitysound.studio/).
- **License:** **CC BY 4.0** — https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
- **Format:** 44.1 kHz stereo WAV, 14 s. A steady broadband fan/AC hum (RMS ≈ −22 dBFS,
  very flat over time) — chosen as the closest faithful match to a continuous computer/PC fan hum,
  since no literal "PC fan" recording exists on Commons.

## 4. Café / office chatter
- **Title:** File:Restaurant ambience.ogg
- **File page:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Restaurant_ambience.ogg
- **Direct file:** https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Restaurant_ambience.ogg
- **Author/credit:** "stephan", originally via pdsounds.org.
- **License:** **Public Domain** (Commons file page: public domain; source pdsounds.org PD).
- **Format:** 44.1 kHz stereo OGG Vorbis, 76 s. Restaurant/café crowd chatter.

## Processing summary (what `make-demos.py` does)
1. Voice passage (17.55–28.30 s) resampled to 48 kHz mono, normalized to −20 dBFS RMS.
2. Each noise trimmed to 10.75 s, resampled to 48 kHz mono, normalized to −23 dBFS RMS
   (→ **SNR ≈ +3 dB**).
3. `before_<noise>.wav` = voice + noise summed in float, then flat-gain peak-normalized
   to −1 dBFS (flat gain preserves the +3 dB SNR; no clipping).
4. `after_<noise>.wav` = `before` run through hushmic's offline enhancer
   (`crates/hushmic-denoiser/examples/enhance.rs`, DPDFNet-8 ONNX model).
5. Videos: 1280×420 H.264 + AAC, ~21.5 s each — the BEFORE waveform with a moving
   playhead, then the same passage AFTER enhancement.

Measured effect (gap = speech pause where only noise sits; 2026-07-09 build):
- Keyboard: gaps −31 → **−58 / −56 dBFS** (~25–27 dB suppressed); speech −1.9 dB.
- Fan: gaps −23 → **−53 / −48 dBFS** (~25–30 dB suppressed); speech −1.9 dB.
- Café: gaps −21/−28 → **−59 / −49 dBFS** (~21–37 dB suppressed); speech −2.4 dB.
