//! Real-time DPDFNet noise suppression for voice, as used by
//! [HushMic](https://github.com/qwertyuiopftft/HushMic-Ahuenno): 48 kHz mono frames in,
//! cleaned frames out. CUDA-first, no network access, `Send` types for the
//! construct-then-move-into-the-audio-thread pattern.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use hushmic_denoiser::{Denoiser, StreamDenoiser};
//!
//! let denoiser = Denoiser::from_file("dpdfnet8_48khz_hr.onnx")?;
//! let mut stream = StreamDenoiser::new(denoiser);
//! # let mic_chunk: Vec<f32> = Vec::new();
//! // in your capture loop, any chunk size:
//! let cleaned: &[f32] = stream.process(&mic_chunk);
//! # Ok::<(), hushmic_denoiser::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! Two external pieces are needed at runtime, neither of which this crate
//! downloads for you (it makes no network calls, ever):
//! - a DPDFNet model file — see the crate README for where to get one;
//! - the ONNX Runtime shared library (default `load-dynamic` feature) —
//!   a distro package works out of the box; bundling apps call
//!   [`init_runtime`] first. Build with `default-features = false` to pick
//!   your own `ort` linking strategy instead.
