//! `pipewire -c` filter-chain, both fighting to create/own `hushmic_source`
//! and the system default source. We take an advisory `flock` on a per-session
//! lock file; the kernel releases it automatically when the process exits (even
//! on crash/SIGKILL), so there is no stale-lock to clean up.

//! the lock held connects to it and exits, and the running instance opens its
//! window — so clicking the app icon always does something visible.
